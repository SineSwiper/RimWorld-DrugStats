# About

So, you've started a new game with your 250+ mods and you're stuck on the Drug Policy screen again.  Vanilla RimWorld already has its numerous nuiances with how its drugs interact, but now you have various alcohols, social drugs, medicines, combat drugs, etc. loaded in.  Most of the drug descriptions don't really tell you enough information.  You have no idea how to set up your drug policies without experimenting with these hundred or so drugs, scanning the wikis for information, or digging into the XML to figure out how they work.  Surely your pawns in RimWorld's future have some form of the Internet to figure this information out already, right?

More Drug Stats makes this effort a lot easier by adding even more drug stats than what's in vanilla, exposing most of the critical statistics you need to make educated decisions on the various drugs in RimWorld and your mod lists.  Figure out what kinds of drugs they are, their tolerances/addiction/overdose thresholds, benefits/risks, all in an organized matter.

Furthermore, this takes the pain out of manually creating a drug policy for hundreds of drugs by creating an automated and sane template, based on their stats.

# Features

* Adds a ton of statistics for each drug, available on the drug information dialog
* Information can be used for populating drug policies, managing addictions, or figuring out the dangers before taking them
* Compatible with any mod that adds new drugs and medicines
* Add a new automated drug policy that can be used as-is, or as a template to copy

# History

This mod started out in RimWorld v1.0 as full drug stats system called "Drug Stats".  A month or so after it was released, Tynan added the vanilla drug stats into v1.1, as prep for the Royalty DLC.  It had a lot of similar stats, so I retired this mod to prevent any conflicts.

Two years later, we're in the middle of v1.3, and I still thought there was a lot of useful data to expose here.  So, I reworked the code to play nice with the vanilla stats, moved some stats and sections around a bit, fixed a few minor bugs, and added the automated drug policy.  It is now called "More Drug Stats".
